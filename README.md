## 1. Supabase setup
1. Open your Supabase project.
2. Go to **SQL Editor** → **New query**.
3. Paste the entire contents of `supabase.sql` and run it once.
4. In **Project Settings → API**, copy:
   - Project URL
   - `service_role` key (keep this secret; never expose it in browser code)

## 2. Local setup
Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill the values:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
APP_SESSION_SECRET=use-a-long-random-secret-at-least-32-characters
ADMIN_PASSWORD=choose-a-strong-admin-password
```

Then:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:3000`.
Admin dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin`.

## 3. Deploy to Vercel
1. Push this folder to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repository into Vercel.
3. Add the same four environment variables under Vercel Project Settings → Environment Variables.
4. Deploy.

## Registration behavior
- A department enters its assigned token and receives a signed HTTP-only session cookie.
- The department name is read from the database and cannot be manually changed.
- The same token returns to the same registration.
- A final submission requires at least 20 and no more than 25 players.
- Team/player statuses are `pending`, `approved`, or `rejected`.
- Admin decisions appear when the team dashboard reloads.
- Approved players cannot be removed by the team.
- Final submission locks team-side edits.

## Image downloads
Photos and logos remain stored privately in the Supabase `competition-files` bucket. The admin interface displays them using temporary signed URLs. The CSV download contains player records, and every player card in the admin dashboard includes a **Photo** button that downloads the stored JPEG. Supabase Storage also keeps files grouped under each department UUID folder for backup/export.

## Production note
The included admin login uses one server-side password for simplicity. For a larger/long-running competition, switching admin access to Supabase Auth with MFA is recommended.
